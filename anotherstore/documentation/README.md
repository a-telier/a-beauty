  The Pink Turnip
This blog aspires to be a community where users can exchange recipes, 
creating a library of vegetarian and vegan recipes to inspire people to 
start a more plant-based diet. 
It all starts one Monday at the time.

##  UX process
### Who is this site for?
This site targets people that are not necessarily vegetarian or vegan, 
but that are looking to start a more plant-based style.

### What does the user want to achieve in this site?
#####   Passive User:
*   This is a user that does not necessarily know the site and that is simply 
looking for inspiration.
-   As a user, I want to browse through recipes, so that I can find a recipe 
I want to make.
-   As a user, I want to be able to quickly identify if a recipe is vegan 
or vegetarian, so that I can make a my choice quickly.
-   As a user, I want to identify recipes that are quick to make, so that I 
can make a my choice quickly.
-   As a user, I want to be able to easily find the information I need in 
the recipe - ingredients, time it takes to prepare, and instructions.
-   As a user, I want to find brands and products that help me achieve a more 
plant-based diet and sustainable lifestyle.

#####   Active User:
*   This is a user that knows the site and wants to be part of the community 
and inspire others by sharing their own recipes.
-   As a user, I want to share recipes with others, so that others can replicate 
what I have made.
-   As a user, I want to see my name on the recipes, so that I can showcase 
my work.
-   As a user, I want to be able to edit and remove the recipes I have created.

### How can the user achieve this?

##  UX Features
This project's ideation started from the Assignment's Mandatory Requirements, and therefore the 
features will be explained in the same order, showing how the project fullfills these requirements.

###### Data handling:
- Created a MongoFB database connected to a Flask-based front-end.

###### Database structure:
- Created a database structure where recipes can be stored with all fields required for front and back-end.
- Created separate collections for Categories and Users which interact with the Recipes collection.
- Created a separate collection called Brands which does not interact with the other collections, it's purpose
it's to display information to front-end.

</div>
<div style="display: inline block;">
    <img width="600" height="300" src="/static/img/documentation/data/collections-interactions.png">
</div>

###### User functionality:
- Users are able to create, edit and delete records that they have added to the database.
- The user can access these records via their profile page.
- The user can interact with those records via the buttons available over each recipe in their profile page.
- In addition, the user is able to search the database by looking at different category pages.

###### Front-end:
- Created a navigation menu via templating in base.html that works both in desktop and mobile devices.
- Created Flask-based templates for the different pages needed for front-end, for example Recipe or Category pages.
- Used the Materialize library to speed up the design process.
- Used icons from both Materialize and Font Awesome libraries to make the interactions more intuitive.
- And added custom HTML and CSS to complete the options not available via the Materialize library.

###### Back-end:
- Imported all of the required libraries for this project.
- Connected the flask front-end to the MongoDB database under an env file which is ignored by git.
- Created a python file called app.py including all the routing needed such as rendering the templated html pages.
- Defined the data types that should be collected in the database when the user is adding or editing the documents 
contained.
- Created authentication requirements, where a user can not access certain pages unless a username is in session.

### Existing Features
###### Navigation:
- Fixed desktop navigation menu - the user is able to navigate through the site and access About, Categories, Brand, Profile and Sign In pages 
by using the navigation menu.
- Mobile navigation menu - when browsing from mobile devices, the user can access a side navigation menu that pops up when the user clicks on 
the burger icon on the top left.
- Sign In/Sign Out navigation - if a user is in session, the navigation button displays the 'Sign Out' option, if thtere is no username 
in session the option displayed is 'Sign In'. This is done via an if statement in the base.html file.

###### Viewing information:
- View existing records in the database - all users (without needing to log in) are able to view recipes that have been added to 
the database. This is done by using a for each statement in the jinja html template, so that each recipe is displayed.
- View single records from the database - this is done by using the routing in app.py to find one recipe from the collection via the 
Object(Id).
- View recipes by category - all users (without needing to log in) are able to see if recipes are vegan or vegetarian via the tag on 
each recipe preview card. This is done by using an if statement in the jinja html template.
- View recipes under 30 minutes - all users (without needing to log in) are able to view recipes which duration is under 30 minutes. 
This is not a user input, but rather a boolean data type set in app.py. When duration is under 30 minutes, the data field returns True, 
which allows us to display the filtered view of the recipes.
- View brands - all users (without needing to log in) are able to see the recommended brands. These are simply displayed from a 
separate collection called 'Brands'.
- View records created - once logged in, the user is able to see the records they have inputted under their profile page.

</div>

###### Authentication of user:
- Register an account - to be able to interact with the database, the user must first create an account. The user is able to do so via the 
'Register an Account' template which adds a new record to the 'Users' collection.
- Sign In function - if the user tries to access the Profile Page, app.py checks if there is a username in session. If no username is in 
session the user is redirected to an html Sign In page.
- Sign Out function - if the user clicks on the Sign Out button at the top right corner of the navigation menu in desktop or bottom option 
in the mobile menu, the user is automatically logged out. The username in session is removed.

###### Interacting with the database:
- Create new records - once logged in, the user is able to submit new records to the database by filling in the 'Add Recipe' form. To 
do this we use the insert function in app.py combined with a jinja template form.
- Edit existing records - once logged in, the user is able to update the records (s)he has previously added by clicking on the 'Edit'
button over each recipe in their Profile Page. This is done by using the update function in app.py combined with a jinja template form.
- Delete existing records - once logged in, the user is able to remove records (s)he has previously added by clicking on the 'Edit'
button over each recipe in their Profile Page. This is done by using the remove function in app.py.

###### Documentation:
At the start of this project, I reviewed some of my classmates submitted milestone III projects which were submitted in the Slack channel 
for peer reviews. One which I found via LinkedIn really impressed me especially due to the attention to detail and overall effort put into 
the documentation and commit logs.
It inspired me to also add images and style my documentation and commit messages.
It also inspired me to test Balsamiq to create my wireframes and visualize my design process.
